{"key" : "S1", "value" : "“How come chickens and foxes don't like each other?” The farmer's son asked his father.\n\nIt was the middle of the afternoon on a hot summer's day and they were out walking through the <color=red>orchard</color=red>.  The little boy was on his school holidays.  He was only six years old and he loved to help his father in the fields or around the farm, especially on warm summer days.  Whenever he could, he would take his father's hand and walk through the fields down along the tree covered laneway beside the stream.  The farmer loved to be in his son’s company when he was working.  He loved to show the little lad all the fantastic things on the farm and to answer all the questions the little boy asked.  His son was very curious about everything and he asked many, many questions.\n\n “Well son,” the farmer replied, “it's not really true about the fox and the chicken not liking each other.  The fact is chickens don't like foxes, but foxes do like chickens.”\n\n“Oh,” said the boy, “I thought they didn't like each other at all.  That's what my teacher said.  She told us at school that foxes and chickens just don't get along.”"},

{"key" : "S2", "value" : "The farmer and his son soon found themselves standing next to the old red tractor, which had broken down years ago.  The tractor had been parked at the side of the laneway near the entrance to the field where the <color=red>dairy-cows</color=red> were grazing.  At the end of the field, on this side of the gate, stood two huge stacks of nice dry bales of <color=red>hay</color=red>.\n\nThe sun was shining and there was barely a cloud in the sky.  There was hardly a breeze and the sky was a deep, dazzling blue.  It was a quiet, warm and bright sunny day."},

{"key" : "S3", "value" : "The only sounds that they could hear were birds, the bees humming in the hedgerows and the bubbling of the little stream which ran under the road.  <color=red>Swallows</color=red> were spinning and skimming through the air catching insects above their heads.  <color=red>Skylarks</color=red> were singing and fluttering high up in the sky, then dropping swiftly back down to earth to run and hide in the tall grasses.  Everything was peaceful and quiet.\n\nThe farmer bent down and lifted the little boy up onto one of the hay bales.  “You sit there,” he said.  “We will have our <color=red>tea</color=red> and biscuits and I will tell you exactly what happened between the fox and the chicken and why the chickens hate the foxes so.”\n\n“It happened a long time ago and it happened right here on this farm.”  The little boy could hardly wait.  He knew that his father knew everything there was to know about everything and when he told him stories, they were always exciting and interesting and true."},

{"key" : "S4", "value" : "The farmer poured a cup of tea for himself and a glass of milk for the boy, then he opened a packet of chocolate biscuits.  Once the little boy was settled down and comfortable the Farmer began to tell his tale.\n\n “<color=red>Chickens</color=red> were not always the way they are today son,” he said.  “A very long time ago, maybe a hundred thousand years, chickens were wild birds.  They did not stay on <color=red>farms</color=red> like our chickens.  They lived in a place called Asia thousands of miles from here.  They lived in a huge dark forest called the <color=red>jungle</color=red> and they had to look after themselves what's more, over that way” and he pointed towards the East.  “In Asia, it was always hot and rainy, and the jungles were dark and dangerous places.  The jungles there are called rainforests because they are so wet and full of all sorts of strange and wonderful creatures.”\n\nThe boy was listening carefully “but how did the chickens get here then?” he asked impatiently.  “Well, I was just about to tell you that,” the farmer replied."},


{"key" : "S5", "value" : "“You see, your great, great, great, grandfather had a job working for the Queen of England, for a time.  When he worked for the Queen, he was a sailor in the <color=red>Navy</color=red>.  He used to work on a massive sailing-ship as a deckhand but in his heart, he always wanted to work on the land.  Over the years he spent working as a sailor he managed to save up enough money to buy this piece of land so that, when he finished with the sea, he could become a farmer.\n\n“He passed the lands and this farm on to his son who passed it on to his son, who passed it on to his son, who was your grandfather, and he passed the farm on to me and that's how we got here.  One day this will all be yours”, he said, as he spread his arms out wide to show the boy the land.\n\n“Anyway, when he was a sailor, he used to go on these long trips sometimes for as long as two or three years.  He used to go to different countries all over the world and one day he was told by the Queen that he was going to have to go to a country called <color=red>India</color=red>, which is in Asia.  He had never heard of India, but he still had to go.”"},

{"key" : "S6", "value" : "“Your great, great, great, grandfather and the rest of the crew had to live and work on their sailing-ship for months and months on end, so they loaded the inside of the ship with enough food and water and all the other things they would need for such a long journey.  The <color=red>sailing-ship</color=red> had three tall masts and big white sails.  As soon as the crew had finished loading all their gear, they set sail for India.\n\nThey sailed for nearly a year before they arrived and I can tell you they had some great adventures on the way, but I will save those stories for another day."},

{"key" : "S7", "value" : "“When the sailors arrived in India, and they first saw this new land, all they could see was beautiful long white sandy beaches where the waves were crashing onto the shore.  In the distance, they could see mountains all covered with millions of trees that came right down to the sea.\n\nThe trees were packed together and were bright, bright green and very, very tall.  That was the first time your great, great, great grandfather and the rest of the crew had ever seen a jungle or a <color=red>rainforest</color=red>.”\n\nThe Captain ordered the men to sail up and down the coast to find somewhere safe for the ship to stop.  After a while, they came to a big bay surrounded by high cliffs on either side which would protect the ship from any bad weather that might come along.  Then the Captain ordered the crew to let the anchor down into the deep blue sea so that the ship wouldn't float away.\n\nOnce the ship was safe, he said, “right lads you've worked really hard to get us here, so you have earned yourselves a break.  You can take the rowing boats off to the beach and have the day off.”"},

{"key" : "S8", "value" : "Well, the crew jumped for joy.  They loaded the rowing boats up with food and water and set off straight away to get to the beach before the Captain changed his mind.  “Be back before nightfall” the Captain shouted after them.\n\nThe sailors rowed to the beach and, when they got there, made barbeques, played football and sang and danced on the sand.  After a couple of hours relaxing, your great, great, great grandfather got bored so he decided to go into the rainforest exploring.  The others all stayed behind.  Most of them had fallen asleep anyway.\n\nYour great, great, great grandfather walked along the beach and then turned and clambered through the bushes and into the rainforest."},

{"key" : "S9", "value" : "When he had gone a few yards, he looked up towards the sky but all he could see high up above him was a canopy of trees blocking out the sunlight.  The tree trunks all around him were enormous and covered in creepers.  There were palm trees and all sorts of other types of vines and ferns that he had never seen before, all growing so close together that he could hardly squeeze between them.\n\nDown on the ground, below all these trees, it was very, very damp and hot and humid and the sunlight only managed to get through in long shafts of light.  It shone on the jungle floor in patches here and there.  He began to sweat, which made his eyes sting.\n\n Everywhere he looked, insects were buzzing and hopping and crawling and flying.  They made so much noise, these tiny little insects, that it began to frighten your great, great, great grandfather.  He thought to himself, “I don't like all this noise I'm going back to the beach.”\n\nJust then, as he was turning back in the direction of the beach, he saw a flash of colour out of the corner of his left eye and then suddenly another flash out of his right eye.  The colours were very bright and they stood out against the green background.\n\nThis made him very curious.  He was curious about everything just like you, a little bit, so he decided that rather than go back to the beach he would find out what those colours were.  What had made them? he wondered to himself.\n\nHe stopped and listened for a moment to see if he could hear anything and sure enough, he heard a sort of scratching noise.  He tiptoed over to a big clump of ferns and noticed that the noise was coming from behind the ferns.  He peeped around the corner and gasped."},

{"key" : "S10", "value" : "There, sitting on the ground, were <color=red>two-birds</color=red> the like of which he had never seen before.  They were jungle-fowl. One of them was multicoloured with yellow and red and purple and blue feathers, some were even white and black.  The other was a drab brownish colour and much smaller.  It was the <color=red>female</color=red>.  The big bird had a strange sort of red hat on its head, both had short stubby beaks.\n\nIt was the big bird who was <color=red>scratching</color=red> the ground searching for grubs.  He had a long feathery tail which stuck out into the air in a long sweeping curve like a pirate's cutlass."},

{"key" : "S11", "value" : "Now, these birds had never seen a man before, so they were quite tame and your great, great, great grandfather was able to walk right up to the <color=red>bird</color=red> which was sitting on the ground under a bush and pick it up.  When he did, he saw ten round looking objects in a small hollow in the ground.\n\nWell, they were eggs.  Now in those days, no one here knew much about eggs or how good they were to eat.  Your great, great, great grandfather had a sudden impulsive thought and he carefully picked up the birds which were incredibly tame and he picked up all ten of the eggs, to keep them all together."},

{"key" : "S12", "value" : "He put the eggs in his baggy trouser pockets and a bird under each arm, before making his way back to the beach.\n\nJust as well he did because when he got back, the other sailors had packed everything up and were loading the rowing boats ready to return to the ship.  One of his friends shouted at him and said he was lucky because they all had thought he had run away and were about to leave without him.\n\nNow, the ship and the crew had a very long journey ahead of them, so they finished exploring the rest of the coastline and soon began the long voyage home."},

{"key" : "S13", "value" : "On the return journey, the men ran out of food and except for the odd fish which they managed to catch, they were getting very hungry.  Luckily during the return voyage, all of the eggs your great, great, great-grandfather brought back from the jungle had hatched into chicks and after a few weeks, all of the new female chickens had laid more eggs of their own.  Then those eggs hatched as well.\n\nThe Captain, seeing that the men were so hungry ordered your great, great, great grandfather to give some of the eggs to the cook so that the men could eat.  This is how we learned that these birds were very good at laying eggs and <color=red>eggs</color=red> were very good to eat.\n\nWhen the ship arrived back home your great, great, great grandfather had one hundred and fifty <color=red>birds</color=red>.  On leaving the ship, he was very generous and gave a couple of birds to each of his best friends so that they could start a collection of their own.  Then, he came home to the farm."},

{"key" : "S14", "value" : "“Now, when he got home to the farm, he made a big <color=red>chicken-coop</color=red> for the chickens to live in until they got used to living here in England” the farmer explained.\n\n“But our chickens don't live in a coop Dad,” the boy said.  “I know son, but as well as the coop he built a big enclosure.  It was made from wooden posts stuck in the ground with lots of wire wrapped around the posts.  That's where the name <color=red>chicken-wire</color=red> comes from.  After a while, once the chickens were used to their new home and they had become used to the weather, your great, great, great grandfather opened the door to the enclosure and let them wander about the farm.”\n\n“The chicken-coop was inside the enclosure, with lots of nice little huts and hiding places in it so if the chickens ever got too cold or scared, they could just run straight back into the enclosure.  Your great, great, great grandfather never closed the door to the enclosure you see.”\n\n“It wasn't long before your great, great, great grandfather realised that the chickens were laying eggs every day and he started to find them everywhere.  Under bushes, inside the enclosure, under bushes outside the enclosure, in the coop and huts, everywhere and do you know what he did with them?”, the farmer asked.  “What did he do with them?” the little boy said with a yawn, thinking this story is getting to be a little bit too long."},

{"key" : "S15", "value" : "“Well, he sold them to the villagers and they were delighted with this new kind of <color=red>food</color=red> that they had to eat.  It made a change from corn and cabbage and rabbit and bacon.”\n\n“But Dad what does this have to do with foxes and chickens?” the little lad asked.  “I thought you were going to tell me why the fox liked the chickens and the chickens did not like foxes.”\n\n“Blimey you're right, I did say that” the father replied.  “I have been going on, let me tell you about that,” he said."},

{"key" : "S16", "value" : "“Well, you see a couple of years went by and the chickens were very happy but around that time other birds and animals started to come along to the farm because they heard that they would find lots of nice things to eat there.  All sorts of birds would fly from miles away.  <color=red>Sparrows</color=red> and <color=red>Pheasants</color=red> and Crows would drop in to pick up the <color=red>grain</color=red> that the chickens were being fed.\n\nThe chickens would go into the woods, over there”, and he pointed to the hills above the farm, “and they would scrape around, just like their ancestors did in the jungle, to find bugs and worms and insects.  The <color=red>Blackbirds</color=red> and <color=red>Robins</color=red> would follow them to pick up the leftovers.”\n\n“Then, attracted by the birds, along came other bigger animals to see what they could find to eat.”"},

{"key" : "S17", "value" : "<color=red>Weasels</color=red> and <color=red>stoats</color=red> came and they found nothing lying around but they did see the chickens sitting on their eggs.  They frightened the chickens and when the chickens ran away, they stole their eggs and broke them open to eat the yolk.”\n\n“Then came the <color=red>rats</color=red>.  Big brown rats.  They were nasty and they chased the stoats and weasels away, then they chased the chickens and ate their eggs as well.”\n\n“Well, your great, great, great grandfather did not know what to do.  He set traps and he sat up at night trying to catch the stoats and the weasels and the rats, but he never managed to stop them.”\n\n“Then, as it happened, a red <color=red>fox</color=red> had been sitting and watching the chickens, who were out in the woods scratching for food.  The fox had never seen a chicken before.  These strange birds, who could hardly fly, were digging up bugs, worms, berries and nuts and having a great feast."}, 


{"key" : "S18", "value" : "They were disturbing the mice and voles, who were then exposed, making themselves an easy target for the fox to catch.  Mice and voles were his favourite food.  The fox lived in a <color=red>den</color=red>, across the valley, with his wife and three <color=red>cubs</color=red>.  When he first heard the strange noises the chickens were making, he crept over to see what the noise was.\n\nHe had been watching the chickens for a few days now to see if there was some way that he could sneak in and catch the mice and voles, or even steal some of their food, without them knowing.  He was hatching a <color=red>plan</color=red>.”\n\n“Late one afternoon, when the fox was studying the chickens, he heard the sound of an almighty scuffle coming from the farmyard where the chickens lived.  There was an awful screeching and cackling sound, a sound he had never heard before.  He wandered over to where the noise was coming from to see what was going on.\n\nWhen he reached the top of the hill he looked down into the farm.  Inside the yard he saw a rat chasing a weasel, who was chasing a stoat and the stoat was chasing a chicken.  They were running in a big circle, around and around a pile of big white eggs.”"},


{"key" : "S19", "value" : "“Now son, you know that foxes are crafty, don't you?” said the farmer, “they are excellent hunters and  can even swim, but they are also very, very cunning and <color=red>clever</color=red>.”  Having watched the chickens for a few days the fox could see an easy way to get a meal without having to work too hard.\n\nHe watched the weasel and the stoat and the rat for a while to try and find out why they were chasing the chicken.  The fox did not like weasels and he was not very fond of stoats either and he certainly did not like rats, but they just kept running and running around in circles after the chicken.\n\n“After watching for some time, the fox decided he would go and help the chicken.  He ran towards them, shouting at the top of his voice and when the weasel and the stoat and the rat saw him coming, they ran off as fast as they could go.”"},

{"key" : "S20", "value" : "The chicken was so grateful that, when she thanked the fox, she asked him to stay and meet the other chickens.  The other chickens came out from where they had been hiding and crowded around to thank the fox.  The fox soon found that he was their hero.”\n\n“However, What the fox did not realise was that it had been the chicken who was chasing the weasel and the stoat and the rat to try to stop them from stealing her eggs.  She had been getting very tired and if the fox had not arrived who knows what might have happened.\n\nThe <color=red>head-chicken</color=red> was a majestic cockerel.  He was as tall as the fox and had a huge red crest and wattle which hung down underneath his chin.  His tail feathers curved up into the air and they were as long as the fox's body.  His feathers were a bright red colour and he had a big sharp, long, yellow beak.  He stood on two sturdy legs with claws that were pointed and strong.\n\nWhen the fox saw him, he was a bit scared of him at first but, the head chicken said, “Mr. Fox, we owe you a huge debt and we want to ask you to stay with us and protect us against those horrible weasels and stoats and rats and in return, we will grant you whatever we can.”"},


{"key" : "S21", "value" : "“Until then Son, foxes <color=red>ate</color=red> berries and insects and small animals like mice and voles.  They could not catch birds who would fly off as soon as any foxes came near them and they had never tasted eggs, so he did not know how delicious eggs could be.”\n\nThe fox thanked the head chicken and he said “Well I have watched the way that you gather food and you are very good at it.  I cannot get under the bushes and scrape and scratch like you because my claws are short and blunt.  If you will let me share your food with you, I will stay and protect you from the weasel, the stoat and the rat.”  Everyone thought that this would be fantastic, so they all agreed."},

{"key" : "S22", "value" : "“But Dad doesn't that mean that the fox liked the chickens and the chickens liked the fox?  That's not what you said, you said that the chickens don't like foxes.”\n\n“Yes, I know I did and now I am going to tell you why the chickens stopped liking foxes. You see the fox and the chickens got on very well, for a while. The other animals never returned to bother the chickens and the chickens shared their food with the fox, but no matter how much the chickens gave the fox to eat he was always, always hungry. Now the fox being cunning and clever and hungry kept on thinking about the weasel the stoat and the rat and wondering why they had been so keen on stealing the chicken’s eggs.”\n\n“Eventually temptation was too much for the fox and one day, when all the chickens were out looking for food, he sneaked back into the farmyard and took one of the chicken's eggs.  He picked it up and dropped it on the hard ground and it broke open.  He looked down at the gold-coloured yolk and after a short period of time, decided to eat it.  It was delicious.”"},


{"key" : "S23", "value" : "When the chickens came back, they did not notice that one of their eggs had gone missing and they offered to share their food with the fox as usual.  The fox said, “Oh it's ok I don't want anything today, I'm not hungry.”  The chickens were shocked and worried and they all thought this was very strange.  “Are you ill Mr. Fox?” the chickens asked, “you're always hungry.”\n\n“Well, this went on for months and the chickens became more and more concerned, until one day, when the fox became too greedy.  Instead of taking one egg he took three eggs but all from the same nest.  When the chickens came back from the woods, they immediately noticed that the eggs were missing.  They asked the fox what had happened and it was then that they saw the broken eggshells and yolk dripping from his mouth.”"},

{"key" : "S24", "value" : "The chickens were horrified and they all crowded around the fox and started screeching and clucking and jumping up and down.  “Get away from here you traitor!!” they all shouted.  “We trusted you and we will never trust you again.”  They all started pecking at him and the rooster came out and puffed out his huge chest.  When the fox saw him coming, he sprinted off and jumped over the farmyard fence and into the woods.”\n\n“And that is why from that day onwards chickens do not like foxes but foxes still like chickens.”\n\n“Especially their eggs.”"}
