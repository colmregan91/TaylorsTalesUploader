{"key" : "swallows", "value" : "• Swallows are small birds.\n\n• Swallows have glossy dark-blue backs, red throats, pale underbellies and tail feathers shaped like a 'V', which are called streamers.\n\n• The male and female adults look very similar but you can recognise young swallows easily.  They have pale orange throats and long tail streamers and are much shorter than the adults.\n\n• Swallows are magnificent agile fliers spending most of their time in the air, on the wing.  Swallows can be found in most countries in the Northern Hemisphere during the spring and summer months.\n\n• Every autumn, swallows fly south to warmer climates of African countries like Botswana and South Africa, where they spend their winters.\n\n• This journey is known as migration.\n\n• During migration, swallows sometimes fly continuously for 200 miles a day.  During their migration, Swallows flock together in large numbers at really high altitudes and their migration routes take them over the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert.\n\n• Many swallows become exhausted and hungry and unable to finish their journey. Others perish in stormy weather.\n\n• The Swallows diet is almost entirely made up of flying insects that they catch on the move.  You can see Swallows skimming close to the ground or over the surface of rivers, streams and lakes at great speed with their beaks wide open when feeding.  They catch large numbers of insects, including flies, aphids and beetles.\n\n• Swallows also eat mosquitoes and other pests, which are dangerous to humans.\n\n• Swallows drink by flying low over the water and scooping up water with their open beaks.\n\n• Swallows like to nest in barns, stables and cowsheds, which tend to be open all the time so they can fly in and out without obstructions.\n\n• They make a cup-shaped nest with their beaks, using mud from river banks or pond edges.  The mud base is bound together using dried grasses then lined with feathers.\n\n• Swallows can make up to 1500 journeys between their nest and the source of the mud to complete the nest.\n\n• Only the female lines the nest, then she will lay three to five white or speckled eggs.  Swallows usually lay two or three broods each year."},

{"key" : "dairy-cows", "value" : "• The collective name for cows is Cattle.\n\n• The adult female is called a cow.

This milking provides man with milk and other dairy products.\n\n• Dairy cows are milked in specially constructed dairy farms and sheds.\n\n• Cattle have extraordinary stomachs.  It is one stomach divided into four separate compartments.  This special stomach helps the cattle to eat, store and digest their food.  Their special stomach allows cattle to eat various tough plants and grasses.\n\n• Cattle swallow their food without chewing it.  They hold it in one of their stomachs four compartments. When all four compartments are full, or the food supply runs out, cattle find a quiet spot where they bring the grass and plants they have eaten back up into their mouths to chew it into tiny pieces slowly.  By doing this, it makes it easier to digest the plants.\n\n• Bringing food back up, like cattle, is known as regurgitating.\n\n• Cattle are enormous hooved animals weighing anything up to 4,000 pounds. That is the same weight as two family cars.\n\n• Cattle live in many countries worldwide and are even worshipped in the Hindu religion."},

About 1 million metric tons is shipped annually between the three countries.\n\n• China is the largest consumer of tea worldwide due primarily to its huge population.  However, Turkey, Ireland and the United Kingdom take the top three places on a per capita basis.  Over 3 billion cups of tea are consumed worldwide each year and it is the second most consumed drink in the world after water.\n\n• In 1908, American businessman Thomas Sullivan shipped samples of tea in fine silk pouches.

Females are buff-brown with black speckles and a long pointed tail.\n\n• Female pheasants or hens make their nests in fields or a thicket at the edge of a wood.  The nest is a scrape in the ground lined with feathers and vegetation.  The female lays a dozen or more olive-brown eggs, which they incubate independently.  The male does not share in this task.\n\n• Young pheasants are called chicks.  They must grow up quickly as they start life on the ground.  Chicks can run as soon as they have dried out from hatching and can fly within two weeks.\n\n• Chicks will remain with their mother for six or seven weeks.\n\n• Man is the the pheasants main predator.\n\n• The main natural predators of pheasants are the fox and wildcats but stoats, weasels and pine martens also take adult birds, chicks and eggs.

When disturbed they can fly but usually for very short distances as they launch airborne with an abrupt, noisy take-off.\n\n• Typically pheasants prefer to run away from trouble, dodging their predators in the undergrowth.\n\n• The Latin name for pheasant is “Phasianus colchicus.”"},

{"key" : "blackbirds", "value" : "• Male Blackbirds are black but the females are brown, often with spots and streaks on their breasts.  The bright orange-yellow beak and eye-ring make adult male blackbirds one of the most striking garden birds.\n\n• Blackbirds are one of the most common birds found in European Gardens but are found as far away as Iceland and the Faroe Islands down to North Africa.\n\n• The Blackbird is known for its melodious song, which can be heard at dawn and dusk.\n\n• The Blackbirds diet is omnivorous and consists of various bugs, insects, worms, berries and fruit when in season.\n\n• Blackbirds are found everywhere in gardens and countryside and from coasts to hills, although not in mountainous areas with high peaks.\n\n• Blackbirds generally stay solitary or in pairs occasionally.  Where there is a good food supply, they will often congregate.\n\n• Male blackbirds will claim territory in their first year, which they will hold throughout their lives.  The territory is essential to attract and keep a mate and for nesting.\n\n• Territories are established and defended against all other blackbirds in the late Autumn and from Spring until July.  The weather determines when the breeding season starts and how long it lasts.  Warm weather creates the right environment.\n\n• Blackbirds nests are built by the female and usually low down in any suitable cover.  Shrubs and climbers are the Blackbirds favourite locations but nests can be found inside buildings and occasionally on the ground.\n\n• The Blackbirds nest is formed into a substantial cup made up of grass, straw, small twigs and other plant material, plastered inside with mud, then lined with fine grass.  It can take two weeks to complete.\n\n• The female incubates the eggs by herself and the chicks hatch 13-14 days later.  Only the female broods the chicks, but both parents feed them.\n\n• The chicks are ready to fledge at 13-14 days, but if the nest is disturbed, they can leave and survive as early as nine days old.  This ability to fledge early is an essential anti-predator adaptation.\n\n• The young birds creep and flutter from the nest and remain in nearby cover for the following few days.  Within one week of fledging, the chicks will be able to fly.\n\n• The chicks become independent three weeks after leaving the nest and leave the parents territory shortly after.\n\n• Young blackbirds can be confused with thrushes or even robins due to their speckly brown feathers.  They're often a rich, reddish-brown colour, especially on their breasts.\n\n• Baby blackbirds usually leave the nest before they can fly. They hop and scramble their way around trees and bushes and are vulnerable to predators at this time.\n\n• As young blackbirds grow, they change their feathers and their colour.  This process is known as moulting, where new feathers replace old feathers.\n\n• Blackbird populations have been dropping due to changing farming practices and the removal of hedgerows.  In rural and urban gardens, blackbird populations have remained stable.\n\n• Farmers and gardeners help blackbirds by avoiding the use of garden chemicals and by planting shrubs that provide blackbirds with caterpillars, berries, or both."},

It is not used in courtship.\n\n• European Robins sing nearly all year round except for a very short period in late summer when they are moulting.  Both sexes sing.  European Robins sing from hidden perches.  The European Robins Autumn and Spring songs are different.\n\n• The Autumn song is mournful, quiet and sad sounding, whilst the Spring song is loud, vigorous and upbeat in its tone.\n\n• European Robins sing in the springtime to defend territory and attract a mate and usually, the male European Robins song is the most powerful in Spring.\n\n• European Robins are often active in the dusk in half-light when few other birds are active.  They are also one of the earliest birds to start singing in the dawn chorus and one of the last to stop in the evening.\n\n• European Robins often sing in the middle of the night around street lights and floodlights.\n\n• European Robins are aggressive defenders of territory and will attack and drive away intruders.  In Summer, a mated pair will defend their territory together.  In the Winter, individuals hold their own territory but boundaries are not fixed and will change frequently depending on circumstances such as food availability, disturbances and predators.\n\n• European Robins like to build their nests on or near the ground, usually in hollows, nooks and crannies, or in climbing plants, hedgerows and tree roots.\n\n• They build nests in piles of logs and use nest boxes that are open-fronted inside a climbing plant or other dense vegetation.\n\n• European Robins often nest in the most unlikely places such as sheds, kettles, boots, hanging baskets, coat pockets, underneath car bonnets, in farm machinery and even on boats in daily use.\n\n• The nest is built by the female shaped like a cup.  It is usually made from dead leaves and moss lined with feathers and hair.  During nest-building and egg-laying periods, the male European Robin will supply a large amount of food to his mate.\n\n• European Robins will quickly desert their nest if they think it has been discovered.\n\n• The female European Robin sits on the eggs alone, hatching taking around 13 days.  When the chicks hatch, they are completely naked.  They depend totally on the parents for food and warmth. Both parents look after the nestlings.\n\n• Their parents tend the young for up to three weeks after fledging.  Frequently the care of the fledged young is left to the male.\n\n• The European Robin is an omnivore and likes to eat worms, seeds, fruits, insects and other invertebrates.\n\n• Robins are often seen closeby when people dig their gardens, waiting to swoop in and pick up worms and bugs exposed by the gardener.\n\n• European Robins take food from birdtables.  Their favourite treats include mealworms, meaty kitchen scraps, fat, cheese, cake and biscuit crumbs, dried fruit, and shredded or crushed peanuts.\n\n• The European Robin, or Robin Redbreast, is found throughout Western Asia and North Africa and Scandinavia as well as Europe."},
